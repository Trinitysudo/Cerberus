**Cerberus Builder** is a Python (v3.9+) GUI application built with PyQt6, designed for R.A.T (Remote Accese Tool) , made for proof of concept and to be the best not malcious
i  am not responsibile for what you do what so ever with this and if you sell it i will slime you out (no kizzy)

## ‚ú® Core Features & Capabilities

Cerberus Builder offers a robust set of features for efficient payload creation and information retrieval:

*   **Intuitive GUI Builder**: A clean, themed graphical interface for easy configuration of all payload settings. Includes a built-in font size adjuster (`+`/`-` buttons) for enhanced user comfort and readability.
*   **Comprehensive System Information Gathering**: Payloads can collect a wide array of data from the target Windows machine:
    *   üñ•Ô∏è **Operating System Details**: Version, release, build, architecture.
    *   ‚öôÔ∏è **Hardware Specifications**: CPU model, cores, frequency; total and available RAM; GPU information (via WMI on Windows).
    *   üíæ **Disk Usage**: Mounted drives, filesystem type, total, used, and free space.
    *   üåê **Network Configuration**:
    *   üìä **Real-time Progress & Logging**: A visual progress bar and a detailed build log area within the application provide feedback to the user throughout the compilation stages.
*   **Standalone Windows Executables**: The builder generates single, portable `.exe` files. These payloads can run on target Windows machines without requiring Python or any external dependencies to be pre-installed, making deployment straightforward.
*   **Organized & Maintainable Codebase**: The project is structured with a focus on readability and future development. Configuration constants, UI styling (QSS), and UI element setup are modularized into separate Python files (`app_config.py`, `ui_styler.py`, `ui_setup.py`).
