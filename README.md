**Cerberus Builder** is a Python (v3.9+) GUI application built with PyQt6, designed for creating payloads that gather system information and can optionally offer more interactive capabilities. This tool is intended as a **proof-of-concept** and for **educational purposes only** to demonstrate information gathering techniques, payload generation, and basic remote interaction concepts.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   üñ•Ô∏è **Operating System Details**: Version, release, build, architecture.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Hardware Specifications**: CPU model, cores, frequency; total/available RAM; GPU info (Windows via WMI).
*   üíæ **Disk Usage**: Mounted drives, filesystem type, total, used, and free space.
*   üåê **Network Configuration**: Details about network interfaces.

### ü§ñ Optional Bot Functionality & Real-time Interaction (Payload Capabilities):

*   **Interactive Agent Mode**: Payloads can be configured to operate in a more persistent "bot" mode.
    *   *(Describe what this mode enables, e.g., "Allows the payload to listen for basic commands sent via a configured channel," or "Enables continuous data streaming to a specified endpoint.")*
*   **Configuration via "Real-time" Tab**:
    *   The **"Real-time" tab** in the Cerberus Builder GUI is used to enable and configure these advanced features for the payload.
    *   This may include settings such as:
        *   Connection parameters (e.g., C2 server address/port, different from the Discord webhook for initial reports).
        *   Check-in intervals.
        *   Specific commands the payload should listen for.
        *   Data streaming options.
    *   *(Be specific here about what can be configured in your "Real-time" tab for the bot functionality).*
*   **Updating Bot Behavior**: To change the bot's behavior or commands it responds to, you would typically re-configure these settings in the "Real-time" tab and generate a new payload.
    *   *(If the "Real-time" tab ALSO allows sending live commands or updates to an ALREADY RUNNING payload, clarify that here. E.g., "The 'Real-time' tab may also provide an interface to send commands to active bots, if a C2 communication channel is established.")*

### Builder Application Features:

*   üìä **Real-time Progress & Logging**: A visual progress bar and a detailed build log area within the application provide feedback during payload compilation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.9 or higher**
*   **Git** (for cloning the repository)
*   A **Discord Webhook URL** (for receiving initial reports from generated payloads).
*   *(Add any other prerequisites specific to the bot/real-time functionality, e.g., a server endpoint if not using Discord for commands).*

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Trinitysudo/CerberusMalware.git
    cd CerberusMalware
    ```
    *(If you've forked this, replace `Trinitysudo` with your GitHub username).*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project's root folder (`CerberusMalware`) in your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Cerberus Builder

Once dependencies are installed, launch the builder application:
```bash
python main.py
